# Transducer-Simulator

A simulator for different transducer models, written in Java

## Transducer models to do

* Deterministic Two-way Transducers (2DFT)
* Deterministic MSO transducer (MSOT)
* (copyless) Streaming String Transducer (SST)
* Heap-based Transducers (disallow traversal in normal nodes captures exactly regular functions)

## Translation algorithms between models to do

* 2DFT <> SST
* SST > MOST
* Heap-based Transducers <> SST
* 2DFT > MOST
